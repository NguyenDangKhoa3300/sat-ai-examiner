But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger. Text 2 Scholars have accepted The Two Noble Kinsmen as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts. Based on the texts, both Sykes in Text 1 and the scholars in Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",,"John Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identifiable style.",The women characters in John Fletcher’s plays are similar to the women characters in Philip Massinger’s plays.,The Two Noble Kinsmen belongs in one-volume compilations of Shakespeare’s complete plays.,Philip Massinger’s style in the first and last acts of The Two Noble Kinsmen is an homage to Shakespeare’s style.
